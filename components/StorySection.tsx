            I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from RMIT University,
            graduating with Distinction. My passion lies at the intersection of
            technology and user experience design, demonstrated by winning
            Apple's Swift Student Challenge with an ADHD accessibility app. üèÜ

            As a 21-year-old international student from Vietnam, I bring fresh
            perspectives to software engineering. I combine technical expertise
            with personal insights to create human-centric, accessible solutions
            that make technology work for everyone. ‚ú®
